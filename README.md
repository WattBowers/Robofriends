This is the first full React app that I created with the help of the great instruction at Zero to Mastery on Udemy. While the website is fairly simple, it taught me quite a bit about the building blocks that react uses to create full apps. How one way data flow allows the app to control state, and hand props down to the lower levels of the app, And render everything on the virtual DOM. This project also taught me quite a bit about some important javascript techniques that make code more readable and functional. Like destructuring of complex objects to simplify how the code looks.

I may come back to this in the future to add a way for a user on the website to add their own robot card to the website.
